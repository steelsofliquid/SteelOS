This issue affects:
  - Steel OS 2.0
  - Steel OS 2.3
  - Steel OS 2.51
  - Steel OS 3
  - Steel OS 4 Alpha
  - Any Steel32 or Steel64 compatible operating systems with the Calculator program from Steel OS

Specifically:
  - Calculator

First appeared: 2023 January

This issue occurs when you attempt some calculations with an answer less than 1. To trigger this,
try to do the equation 1.6 - 1.1 in Calculator on Steel OS 2.3 RTM.

After screen recording and trying to find the cause, it was found that this may likely be caused by
the main display code being "letter 1 of calculator answer" instead of "(letter 1 of calculator answer) + 1".
A patch will be made in SR-1, PLSR, and OS 4 releases.
