-- Steel OS Source Code Packages --
   -- By steelsofliquid on 2023 June 10 [EN-US] --
   
 This directory contains the official source code packages for full, public, 100% stable releases of Steel OS, starting with Steel OS 2.51 and going onwards.
 Each package is either sealed in a ZIP, 7Z, or RAR file, meaning you'll need a third-party program in order to extract the contents. I'll place a list of the
 third-party programs you'll need in order to work on Steel OS a little bit further in this readme. Please note these are the raw resources, being graphics and
 the code for some programs compressed into LZH format (using Bandizip) to compose a program size number for details in the programs folder in the actual release.
 
 You can use these base resources, which are in either JPEG or PNG format for your own use, except to build a direct full-code clone of Steel OS that has been
 rebadged. As this OS is available as demo on Scratch, you'd probably expect for the use of SVG or other vector graphics format, however I choose to use a
 raster graphics format because of my skill with designing operating systems using raster graphics. If you are looking for a direct decompiled version of a build
 of Steel OS, that is yet to happen, I will likely decompile the Steel32 version of Steel OS 3 when it is complete. This readme contains all of the base info about
 Steel OS source code packages, with lists of resource types and third party programs you may need.
 
 -- Base Resources --
  - Raster Graphics used inside Steel OS
  - Raster Graphics that were used inside Steel OS at some point
  - Raster Graphics that were planned for Steel OS, but scrapped.
  - Sounds used in Steel OS (note - Steel OS pretty much used embedded MIDIs for system sounds between 1.0.000 and 2.0.494)
  - Layered Raster Graphics used to compose the used graphics.
  - LZH packages containing source code for software available in Steel OS.
  - Some scattered unfinished documentation about Steel OS.
  
 -- Third-Party Programs you may need (with the respective formats) --
  - 7-Zip (7z Files)
  - WinRAR (RAR Files)
  - Bandizip (ZIP, 7z, RAR, and LZH Files, is what I'd recommend despite it having ads)
  - Paint dot NET (PDN Files. Use this program for any raster graphics used in Steel OS, because using standard MSPaint may break the transparency)
  - Audacity (AUP files in Steel OS 3 or later, as well as any sound files)
  - OpenShot Video Editor 3.0 (Used to split video files into GIFs and MP3s, NOTE THAT NEWER VERSIONS MAY NOT BE AS STABLE, SUCH AS 3.1)
  - Scratch 3 (SB3 Files, Note that possible future versions of Scratch, such as Scratch 4, may be compatible with Scratch 3 projects)
  
 -- Recommended Software --
  - Bandizip (note - contains ads) (compressed folders)
  - Paint dot NET (Paint.NET) (graphics)
  - Audacity 2.3 (audio)
  - OpenShot 3.0 (videos)
  - Scratch 3 (code)
 
 -- Other used resources --
  - Lucida Sans (Font)
  - Lucida Console (Font)
  - Times New Roman (Font)
  - Arial/Arial Narrow (Fonts)
  - Music from YouTube Audio Library
  - Some sounds from Microsoft Windows, BeOS, and the Samsung OEM Windows XP theme (fake Longhorn sounds)
 
Okay, that's everything I have to say! I'll likely create build packages if I can use 7z files to add the full source code.
Enjoy the package! - SteelsOfLiquid ^_^
